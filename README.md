iPadPrototypeSim
================

A companion medical mobile application prototype for iPad.

This project was built for a client to showcase a series of proposed features in a medical mobile app that was to run in conjuction with a sister application on iPhone: https://github.com/elopatin/PhoneProto2

Using Flex it was possible to rapidly iterate through design changes, build in interactivity to a desired level, and overall provide a guided experience for the individuals the client intended to share it with.
